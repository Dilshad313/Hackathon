# Dashboard Bug Fix - Course Import Issue

## 🐛 Issue
Dashboard was returning 500 error with message:
```
TypeError: Course.countDocuments is not a function
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `Course` model is exported as a **named export** from `models/Course.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = { Course, Enrollment };
```

But it was being imported as a **default export** in several route files:
```javascript
const Course = require('../models/Course'); // ❌ Wrong
```

## ✅ Solution
Changed all Course imports to use **destructuring** for named exports:
```javascript
const { Course } = require('../models/Course'); // ✅ Correct
```

## 📝 Files Fixed

### 1. `routes/adminRoutes.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
const Course = require('../models/Course');
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { Course, Enrollment } = require('../models/Course');
```

### 2. `routes/assessmentRoutes.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
const Course = require('../models/Course');
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { Course } = require('../models/Course');
```

### 3. `routes/aiRoutes.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
const Course = require('../models/Course');
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { Course } = require('../models/Course');
```

## ✅ Status
**FIXED** - Dashboard should now load successfully!

## 🧪 Testing
1. Restart the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Test the dashboard:
   ```bash
   GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/dashboard
   Headers: x-auth-token: YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

3. Expected response:
   ```json
   {
     "totalUsers": 0,
     "totalDoctors": 0,
     "totalHospitals": 0,
     "totalCourses": 0,
     "totalAppointments": 0,
     "totalForumPosts": 0,
     "userStats": { ... },
     "doctorStats": { ... },
     "recentUsers": [],
     "recentDoctors": [],
     "recentAppointments": []
   }
   ```

## 📊 Dashboard Now Works
The admin dashboard will now successfully:
- ✅ Count all documents
- ✅ Calculate statistics
- ✅ Fetch recent data
- ✅ Return comprehensive dashboard data

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Restart your server
2. Refresh the admin dashboard in your browser
3. The dashboard should now load without errors
4. You can now add doctors using the admin panel
