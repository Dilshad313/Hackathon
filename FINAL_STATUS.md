# ✅ Admin Module - Final Status Report

## 🎉 Implementation Complete & Bug Fixed

## 🐛 Bug Fixed

### Issue
Dashboard was returning **500 Internal Server Error**:
```
TypeError: Course.countDocuments is not a function
```

### Root Cause
The `Course` model exports as a named export `{ Course, Enrollment }`, but was being imported as a default export in some files.

### Solution Applied
Fixed imports in 3 files:
- ✅ `routes/adminRoutes.js`
- ✅ `routes/assessmentRoutes.js`
- ✅ `routes/aiRoutes.js`

**Changed from:**
```javascript
const Course = require('../models/Course'); // ❌ Wrong
```

**Changed to:**
```javascript
const { Course } = require('../models/Course'); // ✅ Correct
```
